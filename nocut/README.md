## TI-99/4A no-cut mod

The no-cut mod for the TI-99/4A consists of a custom PCB which replaces the original A/V DIN socket:

The PCB is the supported by the printed enclosure:

### PCB

There is now a single PCB (v1.3) for both JST and FFC connector types.

#### Configuration

The 5P/6P jumper is used to connect the correct DIN pin to the ground plane of the no-cut PCB. For 5-pin DINs (most US models), place a jumper between the 5P and middle pin. For 6-pin DINs (most EU/AUS models), place a jumper between the 6P and middle pin.
You can run the board with no jumper at all however the ground for the audio connectors will then be provided via the PICO9918 cable.

To install the PCB:
1. Print and assemble the PCB spacer.
   - Print the 3D printed spacer: [stl/pico9918-nocut-ti99-pcb-spacer.stl](stl/pico9918-nocut-ti99-pcb-spacer.stl)
   - Print 2x copies of the assembly spacer jig: [stl/pico9918-nocut-ti99-pcb-spacer-jig.stl](stl/pico9918-nocut-ti99-pcb-spacer-jig.stl)
   - Insert 8x standard dupont pins from a male pin header into the spacer's 8x holes.
   - Using the assembly jigs on either side of the spacer, clamp the entire assembly together in a vice. This will space the pins centrally in the spacer.
2. Fit and solder the spacer assembly to the BOTTOM side of the no-cut PCB's DIN1 socket.
3. Desolder and remove the A/V connector from your TI-99/4A main board.
4. Fit and solder the original A/V connector to the TOP side no-cut PCB DIN2 socket.
5. Fit and solder the entire no-cut assembly to your TI-99/4A main board via the spacer.

### Enclosure

The vent holes on the black versus beige TI-99/4As are slightly different. For that reason, find either the beige or black version of the enclosure top and the generic enclosure bottom. They should be printed like this:

The case is held together with 4x screws. The screw hole diameter is 2.4mm (3/32"). I use 4G x 3/8 self-tapping screws, but there is some flexibility in screw sizes.
